<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or those that know, they know! For those that don't, a quick google will provide you with the answer you seek.</p>
<p>However, for many of us, it's the start of a new journey, a new path, "<a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rodneycrowell/songforthelife.html" target="_blank">a song for life</a>" as I like to say. For me, I completed my first 90-in-90 in 2005, taking a 3 month break from work and finding the child I had lost oh so look ago</p>
<p>Now, 20 years later I am planning it all over again, in 90 days I will again be taking another 90 day break to give myself some space to find the next the door</p>
<p>So, "90-IN-90" is a blog about that experience, that journey, let's see where it takes you and me...</p>
