	<pclass="intro">For those that know, they know! For those that don't, a quick google will provide you with the answer you seek.</p>
	<p>However, for many of us, 90-IN-90 is the start of a new journey, a new path, a song for life as I like to say.</p>
<p>For me, I done my first 90-IN-90 in 2005, taking a 3 month sabbatical from work and finding the child I had lost oh so look ago...</p>
<p>Now, exactly 20 years later I planning another 90-IN-90, in 90 days I will again be taking another 90 day sabbatical to give myself some mental space to find the next journey in my life... so, this is the blog about that experience, let's see where it takes me...</p>
