<h1 class="pageTitle">About 90-IN-90</h1>
<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">9</span>-in-90 has a number of origins but for me it's about committing to something for 90 days and seeing where it takes you...</p>
<p>For me, I completed my first 90-in-90 in 2005, taking a 3 month break from work and finding the child I had lost oh so look ago.</p>
<p>Now, 20 years later I am planning it all over again, in 90 days I will again be taking another 90 day break to give myself some space to find the next door to open.</p>
<p>So, "90-IN-90" is a blog about the experience, the journey, let's see where it takes you and me...</p>
