<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">N</span>inety in Ninety has a number of origins but for me it has always been about committing to something for 90 days and seeing where it takes you...</p>
<p>2005 and I saw myself taking a 3 month break from work, seeking out the inner child I had lost oh so look ago (heavy, I know!)</p>
<p>Now, 20 years later I am planning it all over again, in 90 days I will again be taking another 90 day break to give myself some space to find the next door to open.</p>
<p>So, "90-IN-90" is a blog about the experience, the journey, let's see where it takes you and me...</p>
