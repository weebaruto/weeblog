<pclass="intro"><span class="dropcap">F</span>or those that know, they know! For those that don't, a quick google will provide you with the answer you seek.</p>
<p>However, for many of us, it's the start of a new journey, a new path, a song for life as I like to say.</p>
<p>For me, I completed my first 90-in-90 in 2005, taking a 3 month sabbatical from work and finding the child I had lost oh so look ago...</p>
<p>Now, 20 years later I am planning it all over again, in 90 days I will again be taking another 90 day sabbatical to give myself some space to find the next journey in my life... so, "90-IN-90" is my blog about that experience, that jounrey, let's see where it takes me...</p>
