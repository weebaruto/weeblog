<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>illy is my "partner in crime" at work, a fountain of knowledge on all things Site Reliability Engineering and an avid fan of the Go programming language, or perhaps he just has a thing for small blue gophers, who knows?</p>
<p>Whether Dilly has influenced me or not, I have grown wary of Java and wanted to give something new a whirl, so I have found myself downloading <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/" target="_blank">GoLand</a> and researching some tutorials to get me startedâ€¦</p>
