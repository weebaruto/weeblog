<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>reakable Tools - My original intention for this upcoming gap was to just throw down tools so to speak, take a year, and do something completely off the beaten track. However, the more I thought about the more I realized I was just pulling a "geographical" and not dealing with what was really bugging me! The fact I was stuck, with a dwindling desire to be a hands-on-keyvboard engineer!</p>
<p>So, I committed to 3 month break addressing 3 key things that are important to me right at this moment - 
* Getting an address on my Juminhyo, so I can avoid problems repplying for my Japanese permenent residency
* Spend some quality time in Japan with friends and family, not forgetting Sumo and Onsen!
* Do something about my dwindling desire to engineer
