<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>reakable Toys - My original intention for this upcoming gap was to just throw down tools so to speak, take a year, and do something completely off the beaten track.</p><p>However, the more I thought about the more I realized I was just pulling a "geographical" and not dealing with what was really bugging me! The fact I was stuck, with a dwindling desire to be a hands-on-keyboard engineer!</p>
<p> So, I committed to 3 month break addressing 3 key things that are important to me right at this moment - </p> 

* Getting an address on my Juminhyo
* Spend some quality time in Japan
* Rekindle the coding vibe

<p>My first thought was to blog about the whole experience, rushing to check out existing platforms. NO, lets not fall into that trap again! We will build something, surely we can achive that?</p>
<p>Hence, I started down that age old adage of employing "Breakable Toys", something fun to do, something I am not worried about be perfect, something I can learn from.</p>
<p>It's barely a start, but I have done more check-ins in the last few weeks than the last 5+ years at work, here's hoping for many more.</p>
